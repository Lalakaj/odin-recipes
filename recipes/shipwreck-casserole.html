  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This budget-friendly shipwreck dinner may not be pretty, but it’s an amazingly delicious and crowd-pleasing way to feed a hungry family.</p>
  <p>The prep time is generally limited to how fast your can opener works and how hard it is to unwrap your meat. The big bonus is that it's a complete one-pot meal!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Ground beef: Start with a pound of lean ground beef. You can also use ground turkey.</li>
<li>Macaroni and cheese mix: Stir a package of macaroni and cheese mix into the ground meat.</li>
<li>Canned tomatoes: You’ll need a can of diced tomatoes.</li>
<li>Milk: A cup of milk helps create a rich and creamy sauce.</li>
<li>Frozen vegetables: A combination of frozen peas and frozen corn adds color and flavor.</li>
<li>Salt: Seasoned salt enhances the overall flavor of the easy dish.</li>
<li>Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese helps bring the whole thing together.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
    Cook the beef until brown and crumbly.</li>
   <li>Stir in the mix, tomatoes, milk, and frozen vegetables.</li>
   <li>Bring to a boil, then simmer until the pasta is tender.</li>
    <li>Season and add the cheese.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Allow the shipwreck dinner to cool, then transfer it to an airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. If you’d like to keep it longer, you can freeze the shipwreck dinner for up to three months.</em></p>
